// This is a simple C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// It uses the standard C library for input and output functions.
// The program starts execution from the main function, which is the entry point of any C program.
// The return value of 0 indicates that the program has executed successfully.
// This code is compliant with the C17 language standard version.
// To compile and run this program, you can use a C compiler like GCC:
// gcc/clang 001Program.c -o 001Program
// ./001Program
// This will display the output "Hello, World!" in the terminal.
