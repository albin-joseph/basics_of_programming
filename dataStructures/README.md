## Data Structures

### Big O
- What is good code?
    - Readable
    - Scalable
    - BigO measure the code scalability
    - BigO notation tell how long the program take to run the algorithm or code
    - We calculate how many steps take perform the function
- **BigO(n)**
    - Linear Time Complexity
    - If the number of item increases number of operations increases

- **BigO(1)**
    - Big O Notattion: O(1) - Constant Time Complexity
    - If input size increase no changes happend
